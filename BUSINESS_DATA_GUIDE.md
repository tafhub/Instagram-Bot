  "targetAudience": "Businesses and Organizations",
  "keyServices": ["Software Solutions", "Technology Consulting"],

const prompt = `Craft a thoughtful reply to: "${caption}"`;
```

### **Future State (With Business Data)**
```typescript
// Enhanced prompt with business context
const businessData = await getBusinessData();
const enhancedPrompt = `
Based on ${businessData.companyName}'s expertise in ${businessData.keyServices.join(', ')}, 
craft a ${businessData.communicationStyle} reply to: "${caption}"

Consider:
- Brand voice: ${businessData.brandVoice}
- Target audience: ${businessData.targetAudience}
- Services: ${businessData.keyServices.slice(0, 3).join(', ')}

Generate a comment that reflects ${businessData.companyName}'s professional approach.
`;
```
